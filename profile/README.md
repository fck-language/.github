# fck language

This organisation contains any and all repositories to do with the source of the fck coding language

## What is fck?

fck is a multi-paradigm programming language[^1] created to allow more prople to get into coding. It is made to be used with any spoken or written language you can think of and provides a host of tools to make working with the language as nice as possible.

To see more about how it works, have a look at the [source](https://github.com/fck-language/fck) or the [dev book](https://github.com/fck-language/dev-book)

[^1]: fck is also both a compiled and interpreted language

## Nothing works

Currently, fck is being developed and will not work. It's been semi-continually worked on for several years (starting in late 2019) by one person and has undergone several re-writes in that time. Eventually, it should at least be functional and maybe even run at a decent speed one day.

If you'd like to help with the development, please have a look at the projects tab for any of the repos to see what needs working on. If you do help out, thank you very much
